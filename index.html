<h2> About Me </h2>
<h4><q>Well, son, I&rsquo;ll tell you: Life for me ain&rsquo;t been no crystal stair,</q>
- Langston Hughes</h4>



<div class = "body-div">

<p>
Hi there! I&rsquo;m Dmitri, a Computer Science and Spanish Literature double major at UNC Chapel Hill.
While that may all sound great, my life has not always been a crystal stair.
</p>
<p>
I was born in this little country called Moldova. You may not have heard of it; it&rsquo;s that little stip of land
between Romania and the Ukraine. Thanks to my mom, she and I were able to move to the US when I was just 7.
My level of English competency was on par with that of an average first grader&rsquo;s Spanish skills in the US.
Not very good, to say the least. They just threw me into second grade and told me, and I&rsquo;m paraphrasing:
<q>We&rsquo;re gonna give you a year to prove yourself in a regular classroom, or else we&rsquo;ll demote you to first grade.</q>
Sounds like a challenge, huh? Well, I sure did prove it to them. Within a year, I was taking advanced placement
English classes like a boss!
</p>
<p>
Let&rsquo;s skip ahead to high school. For the past ten years or so of my life, I had been pretty darn sure that I wanted
to go into the aerospace industry and become an engineer, like both of my parents. Up to that point, I had never really
given progamming a chance. Well luckily, my uncle was an up-and-coming programmer and he thought it would be a great
idea to send me a book on coding. I opened it and quite obviously, I didn&rsquo;t understand a char[] of it
(sorry, bad programmer joke). But then, as if by fate, I saw programming on my high school class catalog and I just knew
that I had to take it. And guess what? I fell in love with it. The ability to mould the digital world around you is
incredibly satisfying. For the first time in my life, I truly felt inspired to become someone great. Not great in terms
of riches and fame, no, but rather, someone who is able to make a difference.
